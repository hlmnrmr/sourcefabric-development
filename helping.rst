Helping others
==============

One of the most underrated ways of contributing is the ability to help others.
We have an important base of users for all our products, and we feel bad because
sometimes we cannot answer users' questions as soon as we wish, just because we
are focused on delivering the best software we can.

Either if you are a user of, let's say, Airtime or Booktype, we invite you to
participate of our forums no matter how. Asking questions, providing help to
others by answering questions.
