Reporting issues
================

.. admonition:: Found a security hole?

   If you think you have found a vulnerability issue, please report it only by
   sending an e-mail to security@sourcefabric.org. The security team will
   process the request before revealing any public announcement. For further
   information on this please read our Security policy page.

We love getting bug reports, and we mean it (smile) It means you are using (or
at least trying out) our software.

Anyone can submit a bug report into our issue tracker system JIRA
http://dev.sourcefabric.org. Keeping low the amount of invalid issues and
creating well-written tickets is something that you can do that will help a lot
the Quality Assurance team and core developers. To do so, please consider the
following pointers:

Before creating a ticket

- Verify if someone else has already reported the same issue. You can do so by
  searching in JIRA. Do not give up with the first try, you can use JIRA's
  advanced search. Keeping JIRA as clean as possible by avoiding duplicates is
  really important for us.
- If you find there is already an open ticket reporting the same issue, please
  contribute by adding as much information as you can, especially if you think
  it would help us to easily reproduce the problem.
- Do not create a ticket if you are not certain the issue is a bug. Ask in the
  forums. Our developers are constantly following conversations and answering
  questions.
- Do not use JIRA to ask questions, that's what the forums are for.

When creating a ticket

- Well-written reports are extremely important. By doing so you are helping us
  to easier understand and reproduce issues, and get processed more effectively.
- A few hints for what we consider a well-written bug report:
  - Report only one issue per ticket. Including different issues in the same
    report will make things less readable and much harder for us.
  - Provide a complete, concise and clear description of the issue.
  - Provide a set of detailed steps to reproduce it.
  - Provide details on the specific platform you are using: browser and browser
    version, operating system, Web server setup, etc.
  - Provide as much relevant extra information as possible (e.g. stuff like
    messages from error logs and exception backtraces.)
- There is no need to notify in the forums that you have reported a bug. Every
  time you create a new ticket, core developers are automatically notified.

Once you have created a ticket into JIRA, more likely you want to know what will
happen next. Here you can read how we process a ticket and understand its
lifecycle.
