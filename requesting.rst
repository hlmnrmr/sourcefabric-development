Requesting features
===================

In Sourcefabric, we are always looking for ways to make the software we produce
better, and contributing ideas is an essential part of this process. Here you
will find how to effectively submit feature requests.

- In our issue tracker, for each of our projects, you will find a milestone
  called User Requests. Creating a ticket in User Requests is the way your
  idea will get more attention. The Project and Innovations teams in
  Sourcefabric keep an eye and manage all submitted requests.
- The more information you provide the better. Describe clearly, as part of the
  description of the ticket, what exactly the feature is about and why you
  consider it to be interesting and useful. Providing a set of use cases is
  always helpful.
- Pay attention to the related ticket you created in the issue tracker, our
  development team will likely start a conversation and give you some valuable
  feedback.
- If the feature gets accepted it will be pushed to the roadmap and develop for
  one of the upcoming major releases.
- If you are a programmer and you want to implement the feature yourself, that
  will make us happy (smile) Code contribution is always welcome. Follow the
  guidelines here: Writing code.
- If you have already started working on the feature, show us your code! Good
  code speaks better and gives you the best chance to get it accepted.
