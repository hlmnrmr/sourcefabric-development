Documenting
===========

Documentation is treated in Sourcefabric in a way that it is as important as
writing code. We do care about writing software in the best possible way, but
that is not enough. Writing precise documentation is the most natural mean to
make the software easier to be adopted, and we try to do so. Documenting though
is in a way similar to coding, as you need to invest time on structuring,
composing, testing, fixing, updating, etc.

You can help us in all this process in a few different ways:

- Documenting new features
- Translating
- Fixing issues
- ... and the simplest yet important, reporting issues

This guide aims to provide all information ...
